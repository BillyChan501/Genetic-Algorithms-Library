==========================

Genetic Algorithm Library is a set of C++ classes that allows easy implementation of basic genetic algorithms. It contains many pre-defined selection, mutation, crossover and other basic genetic operators as well as few implementations of algorithms. It also provides framework for writing custom operators and genetic algorithms.
